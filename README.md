I. PREFACE

The contents of this repository have been intentionally █████████████████.
Any attempt to decipher, interpret, or understand the structure herein will be logged, timestamped, and politely ignored.

Proceeding beyond this point implies consent to terms that were ███████ in Appendix ██, which no longer exists.

II. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The initiative known as ███████ operates under the directive of the DECK//███ MATR██ program.
Primary objectives include:

███████████████████████

███ data consolidation for ████ ████████ ███

Ongoing ██-tier diagnostics

Prevention of Event [REDACTED]


Any secondary objectives are classified at a level exceeding your current ocular tolerance.

III. INSTALLATION

1. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements:

CPU: █████

RAM: ██GB (recommended: ███GB)

Dependencies: ████████.sh, ██████.json, and that one file you definitely didn’t delete.



2. Perform the traditional invocation ritual.


3. Reboot twice.


4. Ignore the screaming.




---

IV. USAGE

Run:

./███████ --init --silence-errors --███

If the terminal begins emitting tones, that is expected.
If the tones form words, document them and then forget them immediately.

V. STRUCTURE

The architecture appears to rearrange itself every ~7 hours. This is a feature.
